# SAML Access

The SAML authentication allows to rely on a federated identity repository. In this case, `Tomcat` will **delegate** the `authentication` and the `authorization` mechanism to a third party (the Identity Provider).

This use case is very interesting when an **Identity Provider** has been deployed in the company or if the solution aims to be used from a **Cloud based** environment. It will literally rely on the Identity Provider for such purposes.  

What's interesting here is that the Identity Provider does not need to be installed on the Tomcat server, it is another server.  

> When authenticating in **federated** mode, the protocol of choice is [SAMLv2](https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/FrontPage#SAML_V2.0_Standard).  

Here is how it works:  

- The **User Agent (UA)** is the end user web browser  
- The **Service Provider (SP)** is the Identity Analytics tomcat web server  
- The **Identity Provider (IdP)** is the third party accountable for authentication and authorization  

![SAML access architecture](../images/SAML_access_architecture.png "SAML access architecture")

As you can see here, everything is done through the `HTTP`/`HTTPS` protocol with simple `HTTP redirects` and `HTTP forms`.  
When the user attempts to connect to the service provider, it detects that the user is not authenticated, generates a **challenge** in `SAML` format and redirects the user to the **identity provider** with this challenge.  
The **identity provider** analyses the challenge, authenticates the user and redirects him to the **service provider** with a `response`. The response contains all the required information regarding the **user** and his **roles**.  

The `SAML` challenge/response mechanism involves `XML`, `time stamping` and `XML digital signature` (at a glance, a challenge is sent to the **identity provider**, a response is built by the **identity provider**, it contains the user _identity_, his _roles_, the initial challenge and a validity time frame. The response is **digitally signed** by the identity provider. The response is sent back to the **service provider** which verifies the digital signature, the challenge, the validity time frame and acts accordingly).  

Almost all major players are now leveraging the `SAMLv2` protocol to authenticate users and are acting as **Identity providers (Idp)**:  

- Microsoft ADFS
- Google G suite
- Sales force

You can also delegate authentication and authorization to best of breed solutions through the `SAMLv2` protocol:  

- Okta
- InWebo
- LastPass
- OneLogin
- Forgerock
- ...

Identity Analytics is providing a sample implementation of the `SAMLv2` protocol for `Tomcat 8/9`. You will find here all the information needed to configure `SAMLv2` support for authentication and authorization with a **third party Idp**.  

This implementation is `SAMLv2` compliant and should be used with **any identity providers** `SAMLv2` compliant.  

## Configuration procedure

### Step 1: Declare the Identity Analytics application in IdP

First step is to declare your Identity Analytics Web application in order for the IdP to recognize it and perform AuthN/AuthZ process for User Agent request coming from the application.

Identity Analytics provides some samples regarding some IdP:

- [Okta](./okta.md)
- [InWebo](./inwebo.md)
- [G-Suite](./gsuite.md)
- [ADFS](./adfs.md)

> [!warning] The information listed above is provided as an example only. This methodology is not supported by Identity Analytics, but has been tested.

At the end, no matter the IdP solution, a XML metadata file that represents this SP configuration should be generated and provided by the IdP to be deployed in SP side (see later in this article).

### Step 2: Deploy SAML configuration in Tomcat

In the following procedure, we will use below variables:  

|         Variable         |                                  Description                                  |          Example value          |

#### Prerequisites

To ensure this installation procedure, you should first download some required `<SAML_BW_ARCHIVE>` and `<SAML_BW_LIB>` Identity Analytics libraries available [here](https://download.Identity Analyticsgrc.com/index.php/s/n3qGRqKgtADw4Hn) depending on the Tomcat version installed:  

- Tomcat 8 (tested with **Tomcat 8.5.9**)
  - `bw-tomcat-8.5-saml-libs.zip`
  - `bw-tomcat-8.5-addons.jre8-X.jar`
- Tomcat 9 (tested with **Tomcat 9.0.53**)
  - `bw-tomcat-9.0-saml-libs.zip`
  - `bw-tomcat-9.0-addons.jre8-X.jar`

It is also admitted that:  

- Tomcat instance is installed and available  
- The operator has RW privileges in needed files and folders to proceed to the installation  

> This sample implementation relies on [OpenSAML](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/OpenSAML/Home) and [LastPass SAML](https://github.com/lastpass/saml-sdk-java), both provided under `Apache License`, Version 2.0.  

#### Tomcat configuration

> If you are under Linux, beware of files and folders rights.  

First step is to deploy Identity Analytics SAML libraries, JDBC driver and Authenticators in Tomcat:  

Under the `<TOMCAT_LIB_FOLDER_HOME>` folder.  

- Add following files: `<SAML_BW_ARCHIVE>`
- Unzip the archive in this folder: `<SAML_BW_LIB>`
- Create a folder `org/apache/catalina/startup`. In this folder, create a `Authenticators.properties` file with below content

```properties

BASIC=org.apache.catalina.authenticator.BasicAuthenticator
CLIENT-CERT=org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SSLAuthenticator
DIGEST=org.apache.catalina.authenticator.DigestAuthenticator
FORM=org.apache.catalina.authenticator.FormAuthenticator
NONE=org.apache.catalina.authenticator.NonLoginAuthenticator
SPNEGO=org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SpnegoAuthenticator
SAML=com.Identity Analytics.tomcat.authenticator.saml.SAMLAuthenticator
```

Next step is to create and configure the `SAMLAuthenticator.properties` file. Under the `<TOMCAT_CONF_FOLDER>` folder, Create a `SAMLAuthenticator.properties` file with below content.

```properties
# SAML Authenticator property file
# copyright Radiant Logic

# idpMetadata: Identity Provider Metadata as an XML file located in the /conf subdirectory by default
# spMetadata: Service Provider Metadata as an XML file located in the /conf subdirectory by default
# roleMapping: contains a properties file name, located in /conf. It converts a dynamic role name provided by the Identity Provider to a local role name,
# the property file is on the form idprolename=localrolename
# defaultRoleList: Roles associated to the user by default as a comma separated string
# staticRole: contains a properties file name, located in /conf. It lists all the roles per principal, the property file si in the form login=roleList where roleList is in the form role1,role2,role3
# checkRealm: Once authenticated through SAML, do we test the 'user' against the configured Realm? (this can be useful if you want to configure user roles locally or with a third party Realm).
# Note: The test is done with the user login and a blank password.
# roleAttribute: If any, the name of the SAML response attribute which contains the list of the dynamic roles for the user (most of the time groups names)
# genericUsers: If any, the name of the roles names who will be used as user names: if the user is a member of such group, the group becomes the user name. It is used to convert single
# authentications to generic accounts where the
#               account name represents a profile such as "standard user", "power user", "admin user"
# genericUserPattern: when a genericUser is found, this optional parameter can be used to format the user login. {login} and {generic} can be used and will be dynamically replaced by their
# corresponding value. For instance: {login}({generic})
# defaultURI: The URI where the user will be redirected once the authentication is done. This is used for "Idp initiated use cases" only, when dealing with "SP initiated use cases", the user is redirected
# to the initial URL in any case
# forceURI: The URI where the user will be redirected once the authentication is done in any case, except when dealing with "SP initiated use cases"
#
# To add debugging infos, please add the following line at the end of the /conf/logging.properties file:
# com.Identity Analytics.tomcat.authenticator.saml.SAMLAuthenticator.level = ALL

idpMetadata=<SAML_IDP_METADATA_FILE>
spMetadata=<SAML_SP_METADATA_FILE>
roleMapping=<SAML_ROLE_MAPPING_FILE>
defaultRoleList=user
staticRole=<SAML_STATIC_ROLE_FILE>
checkRealm=false
roleAttribute=groups
genericUsers=user
genericUserPattern={login} ({generic})
defaultURI=<WEBAPP_URI>
forceURI=<WEBAPP_URI>
```

Above fields should be set accordingly to your project context. Here is a short description of those configuration attributes.

For each property, you can find more details [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/igrc-platform/installation-and-deployment/Identity Analyticss-web-portal/portal-access/saml/saml-authenticators-properties.md %}).

### Step 3: Identity Analytics Portal generation

From your Studio, in the `Export` tab of your project **technical configuration**:

- Select `SAML authentication`

![SAML authentication](../images/saml_project_export_configuration.png "SAML authentication")

- Save your technical configuration
- Generate the `<WEBAPP_NAME>` **web portal** using [igrc_portal](../../../02-batch-configuration-and-usage) command line or from the Studio

Once configured, a new `SAML` authentication method is available.

> Note: the SAML method is declared in the `/WEB-INF/web.xml` file under the security configuration in the `auth-method` parameter.  

```xml
<login-config>
<auth-method>SAML</auth-method>
</login-config>
```

If you don't setup `SAML` authentication schema from technical configuration, you won't be able to authenticate via `SAML`.  

> The `SAML` configuration is declared in the `<TOMCAT_CONF_FOLDER>/SAMLAuthenticator.properties` file configured earlier.  

### Step 4: Deploy Identity Analytics Portal

> If you are under Linux, beware of files and folders rights.

Once your `<WEBAPP_NAME>` webapp is generated, the last step is to:  

- Deposit it under `<TOMCAT_INSTALL_FOLDER>/webapps` folder
- Start the Tomcat

The Portal should be accessible from your browser using `<WEBAPP_URL>/<WEBAPP_URI>`.

## Debug

To activate traces, add the following line at the end of the `/conf/logging.properties`. Do **not** use this in **production**. This is just for troubleshooting `SAML` request/response.  

```xml
com.Identity Analytics.tomcat.authenticator.saml.SAMLAuthenticator.level = ALL  
```
