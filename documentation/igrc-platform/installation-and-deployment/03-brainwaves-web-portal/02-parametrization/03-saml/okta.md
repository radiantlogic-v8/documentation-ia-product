Fulfill the general settings: the nick name of your Identity Analytics project, a logo, ...  

![okta2](./images/okta2.png "okta2")

Fulfill the SAML attributes:  

The **SAML URI** is `/acs` within your Identity Analytics portal. For instance, if your deployment is `https://myhost/mybrainwaveapp`.  
The **SAML URL** to use will be `https://myhost/mybrainwaveapp/acs`.  

The **Audience URI** is `brainwavesaml`, it can be updated if needed (see below).

Keep the default parameters in the advanced settings.

If you want to propagate roles from the Identity Provider you need to fulfill the `group attribute statements`.  
The name will contain the name of the `SAML` attribute which will contain the groups, the filter will select the groups to send to the Identity Analytics instance amongst the total list of user groups.

Once the configuration is done, click on `Identity Provider metadata` to download the idp configuration. Rename the file to `idp-metadata.xml`.  
You will use it to declare your **Okta** instance in **Identity Analytics**.
