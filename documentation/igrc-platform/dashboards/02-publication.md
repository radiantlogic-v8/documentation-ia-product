# Publish the Dashboard

Once your dashboard is ready, and you are satisfied with its content, you can publish it to a selection of people inside your organization.

A dashboard can be in either of the publication states:

- **private** : only visible and editable by its author
- **published** : visible and editable by its author and visible by selected people

A newly created dashboard is private by default. To publish it, do the following:

- the dashboard is private by default.
- Select **Publish...** from the dashboard menu , to open the publication tab of the dashboard configuration wizard  
- Select a rule from the **Publish for** list of rules. Only portal-enabled rules targeting identities will be displayed.
- Click the **Test** button to verify that the rule retrieves the intended identities.
- Click **Finish** to make the dashboard public.
- Additionally, you may notify the dashboard recipients of the newly added dashboard.

To publish minor changes to an existing dashboard :

- Edit the dashboard
- Make the changes
- **Save** the dashboard, changes are made available to its current recipient list.

To publish major changes to an existing dashboard:

- Select **Unpublish** from the dashboard menu. It's recommended to make the dashboard private during the changes, until it's in a consistent state.  
During the changes, the dashboard may disappear from users displays if they log out or reload their configuration.
- Make all your changes, you can **Save** the dashboard as often as you like, changes won't be visible to users.
- Once you are done with the changes, select the **Publish** menu item, the dashboard will be published again to the same recipients.
- Additionally, you may notify the dashboard recipients of the changes.

> [!warning] Users must select **Reload dashboard and styles definitions**  in the the web portal menu to view any changes to their dashboards (modification, additions or removals). Logging out and back in has the same effect.
