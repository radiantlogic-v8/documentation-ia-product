# Using the wizard

IGRC Includes a wizard to easily create new pages. To use we can right click and create new file :  

![Wizard 1](./images/0501.png "Wizard 1")  

The wizard will show up and ask us to define a name of the file  

![Wizard 2](./images/0502.png "Wizard 2")  

In the next step we will define a page identifier, and a title ( The only required attribute ). We can also select a template (Blank page in the example):  

![Wizard 3](./images/0503.png "Wizard 3")  

When we hit finish we will have a new page file created using the best practices for internationalisation and with comments to include the different blocks in the right places.  

![Wizard 4](./images/0504.png "Wizard 4")  

Page is ready to be modified  

## Things to remember

Creating pages using the wizard is easy and provides templates that help you follow the best practices
